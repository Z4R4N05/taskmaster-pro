## Description
A To-Do app where you can create a task, and select the due date for that task. When that task starts, you can move it to the "In Progress" field. As you progress on that task, you can move it to the "review" field and see what was accomplished. When you feel you do not need anything else regarding that task you can move it to the "done" field, or to the "Drop Here to Remove" at the bottom of the app to completely delete it.
